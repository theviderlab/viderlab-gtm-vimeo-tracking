# Script for tracking Vimeo videos with GTM
Use this script on a HTML tag on Google Tag Manager for tracking Vimeo videos on your website.

This script was originaly created by Cardinal Path, and updated by Julius Fedorovicius.

On this version I changed the script so it also works with not listed videos.

viderlab-gtm-vimeo-tracking: works on pages with multiple embebed Vimeo videos.

viderlab-gtm-vimeo-simple-tracking: a simple version that works on pages with only one Vimeo video.
